# Text_Based_Adventure_Game
This game was developed in my first semester of college in a group of 3. This was our final project for the class and the game follows a player living at Michigan Tech and trying to get from their dorm room to the dining hall. Along the way there are obstacles and they must figure out the puzzles to survive and make it to the dining hall.

Run the AdventureClient to get the server started, and run the TechAdventure class to play the game. The classes for the server were provided to me and my team, and we had to adapt them to fit our Room, Player, Monster, and TechAdventure classes which we made from scratch. The game is not completely bug free, as the monster introduced some minor bugs, however, it works for the majority of the time
